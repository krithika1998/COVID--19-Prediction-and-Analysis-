# COVID--19-Prediction-and-Analysis-
The motivation behind the project is to find a correlation between various factors like demographics, vaccinations to the increase in contraction rate. A time series and bar plot was used to show the correlation between various predictors.

COVID-19 is a pandemic of respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 Virus, which was discovered in 2019. The project presents the pattern of COVID-19 pandemic which can be utilized to develop preventive measures in order to prevent or handle
future pandemics. A model is developed to predict the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s death rate, impact of vaccination on the COVID-19 death rate and an analysis of the vaccination count in each state in the United States of America.
